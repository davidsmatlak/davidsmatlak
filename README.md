# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer currently employed by **Aquent** and on assignment at **Microsoft**. My role
is to complete documentation projects for Azure services and my focus is [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager).
I collaborate with senior content developers, software developers, and product managers.

## Projects and tasks

The following list summarizes some of my projects as a technical writer since November 2018:

- Contributed to the successful release of [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep)
  documentation. My tasks included writing Bicep documentation and code samples, and copyediting content.
- Completed a project to copyedit and review ARM template quickstart articles and review JSON
  templates that are used to deploy 80 Azure services. I updated [Samples - Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/)
  articles to comply with style guidelines and updated [ARM quickstart templates](https://github.com/davidsmatlak/azure-quickstart-templates/commits?author=davidsmatlak)
  using best practices guidance.
- Previous assignments included writing and copyediting documentation for [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell)
  and [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery).

Along the way I've learned the basics of how to create PowerShell functions and scripts, and how to
deploy Azure resources with Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, ARM template JSON, and Bicep files.

## Professional interests

- :hammer_and_wrench: Continue to learn about ARM templates using JSON and Bicep, Azure CLI, and
  PowerShell.
- :books: Started a personal project to learn Python. Current tasks to learn the language are to read _Automate the boring stuff with Python_ and write basic scripts.

## Certification

[Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals)

## Writing samples

To see my writing samples go to [davidsmatlak.github.io](https://davidsmatlak.github.io). The
site is built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and the content is written with Markdown. To display features such as alert boxes, I use HTML and CSS.
