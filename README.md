# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer currently employed by **Aquent** and on assignment at **Microsoft**. My role is to complete documentation projects for Azure services and my focus is [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager). I collaborate with senior content developers, software developers, and product managers.

## Projects and tasks

The following list summarizes my projects as a technical writer since November 2018:

- Copyedit [ARM template quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/) articles for more than 80 Azure services.
- Review and update the [ARM quickstart templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) to deploy those 80+ Azure services.
- Convert Word documents to Markdown to prepare content for publication.
- Resolve GitHub issues submitted by the ARM community.
- Copyedit existing content to ensure content is up-to-date with style guidelines.
- My previous assignments included documentation projects for [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell) and [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery). I improved documentation with copyedits for style and grammar, and updates for code samples.

Along the way I've learned the basics of how to create PowerShell functions and scripts, and how to deploy Azure resources with Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and ARM templates.

## Professional interests

- :hammer_and_wrench: My goal is to continue learning about ARM templates and JSON, Azure CLI, and PowerShell.
- :cloud: :books: My personal project is studying for the Azure Fundamentals certification exam.
