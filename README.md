# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer currently employed by **Aquent** and on assignment at **Microsoft**. My role
is to complete documentation projects for Azure services and my focus is [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager).
I collaborate with senior content developers, software developers, and product managers.

## Projects and tasks

The following list summarizes my projects as a technical writer since November 2018:

- Participated in the successful release of Bicep documentation. Tasks included writing Bicep code
  samples, updates of existing Bicep documentation, content migration, and copyedits.
- Completed a project to copyedit and review ARM template quickstart articles and review JSON
  templates that are used to deploy 80 Azure services. I updated [Samples - Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/)
  articles to comply with style guidelines and updated [ARM quickstart templates](https://github.com/davidsmatlak/azure-quickstart-templates/commits?author=davidsmatlak)
  using best practices guidance.
- Convert Word documents to Markdown to prepare content for publication.
- Resolve GitHub issues submitted by the ARM community.
- Copyedit existing articles to ensure content complies with style guidelines.
- Previous assignments included documentation for [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell)
  and [Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery). I improved
  documentation with copyedits for style and grammar, and updates for code samples.

Along the way I've learned the basics of how to create PowerShell functions and scripts, and how to
deploy Azure resources with Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, ARM template JSON, and Bicep files.

## Professional interests

- :hammer_and_wrench: Continue to learn about ARM templates using JSON and Bicep, Azure CLI, and
  PowerShell.
- :books: Learn more about how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for documentation projects.

## Certification
